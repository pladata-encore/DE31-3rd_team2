# Spark

**Description**

we want to set up spark cluster enviroment 
one spark-master and two spark-workernode,  

each IPs are

```
spark-master : 192.168.0.159:17077 
spark-worker : [192.168.0.160, 192.168.0.161]

spakr-client(submit): 192.168.0.163
```

which Ips start "192..", this means that their network are private network.  

So in this setting, we only use cluseer in this private network

but There is Way!   
you want to use this cluster, plz contect us, let you know the server ip in this private network.

this is the reason that why does server-client exist in this setting
